## Using Modules 
You can find more information in the video and EasyProgramming.net links above. And to get started, remember you include your JavaScript file with type `module` as shown below:

```html
<script src="main.js" type="module"></script>
```

You only need to do this for your main JS file as it is the parent. All other JS files will be exported then imported into the main JS as shown in the tutorial.
